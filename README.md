animix

The original purpose is to keep dance animations. After a while other features where added. Unfortunately I abandoned the app long ago and just realized that never really published it. I thought there were some good implementation pertinent to the prevention of lag. I welcome all constructive critizism. Those ideas might awaken my desire to further develop the script.

As a Unix developer the command line has a special place in my heart, even more so than any family member has ever had :) Although SL is a 3D environment CLI operation as very alive with the use of channels/chat. A feature that was a clear necessity early on was the ability to invite others to share the HUD animations via chat. Back in the days where lag was so bad that a click could actually take minutes or even crash a simulator is when I found it to be the most valuable. Even today when it is almost impossible click on an avi using one of those high energy animations can be quite useful. And of course, the invite will be sent to the closest avatar matching the partial word to make it even more conventient.

I will do my best to describe what is currently avaiable. I cannot evern rememember at this point. I am a documentation freak. Unfortunately, due to the nature of scripts in SL the comments inline can contribute to the lag of the software. I will try to come up with a system where lenghty explanations of features or code can be shared.

Here is a partial outline of of what is currently available:

1. Unlimited number of categories
2. My special flavor of a titler, (used to be popular back in the day)
3. You can offer exclusive invites
